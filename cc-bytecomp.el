;;; Commentary:

;; This file is used to ensure that the CC Mode files are correctly
;; compiled regardless the environment (e.g. if an older CC Mode with
;; outdated macros are loaded during compilation).  It also provides
;; features to defeat the compiler warnings for selected symbols.
;;
;; There's really nothing CC Mode specific here; this functionality
;; ought to be provided by the byte compilers or some accompanying
;; library.  To use it from some package "foo.el", begin by putting
;; the following blurb at the top of the file:
;;
;;   (eval-when-compile
;;     (let ((load-path
;;            (if (and (boundp 'byte-compile-dest-file)
;;                     (stringp byte-compile-dest-file))
;;                (cons (file-name-directory byte-compile-dest-file) load-path)
;;              load-path)))
;;       (load "cc-bytecomp" nil t))
;;
;; This (unfortunately rather clumsy) form will ensure that the
;; cc-bytecomp.el in the same directory as foo.el is loaded during
;; byte compilation of the latter.
;;
;; At the end of foo.el there should normally be a "(provide 'foo)".
;; Replace it with "(cc-provide 'foo)"; that is necessary to restore
;; the environment after the byte compilation.  If you don't have a
;; `provide' at the end, you have to add the following as the very
;; last form in the file:
;;
;;   (eval-when-compile (cc-bytecomp-restore-environment))
;;
;; Now everything is set to use the various functions and macros in
;; this package.
;;
;; If your package is split into several files, you should use
;; `cc-require', `cc-require-when-compile' or `cc-load' to load them.
;; That ensures that the files in the same directory always are
;; loaded, to avoid mixup with other versions of them that might exist
;; elsewhere in the load path.
;;
;; To suppress byte compiler warnings, use the macros
;; `cc-bytecomp-defun', `cc-bytecomp-defvar',
;; `cc-bytecomp-obsolete-fun', and `cc-bytecomp-obsolete-var'.
;;
;; This file is not used at all after the package has been byte
;; compiled.  It is however necessary when running uncompiled.
